I am an Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University, [Carey Business School](https://carey.jhu.edu), an affiliate of the [Hopkins Population Center](https://popcenter.jhu.edu), and the [Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science](http://idies.jhu.edu).

I study how social interactions shape individual and aggregate 
socioeconomic outcomes, using tools from economic theory, 
econometrics, applied probability and computational methods.

I received a PhD in Economics from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://economics.illinois.edu), a Master of Arts in Economics from [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/econ.html) and a Laurea in Economia Politica from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/)
