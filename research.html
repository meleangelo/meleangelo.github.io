<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong>  Existing indices of residential segregation are based on
a partition of the city in neighborhoods: given a spatial
distribution of racial groups, the index measures different
segregation levels for different partitions. I propose a
spatial approach, which estimates segregation at the individual level
and produces the entire spatial distribution of segregation. This method
provides different rankings of cities in terms of segregation
and new insights on the effect of segregation on socioeconomic
outcomes. Using Census data and controlling for endogeneity using
instrumental variables, I show that reduced form estimates of the impact
of segregation on socioeconomic outcomes are not robust to the
spatial approach.

Structural Model of Segregation in Social Networks
</a></b>, July 2013<br> <i>2nd revision requested</i>, Econometrica<br>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong> The main challenges in estimating strategic network formation models
are the presence of multiple equilibria, and the fact that the number of
possible network configurations increases exponentially with the number
of players.
I propose a dynamic model of strategic network
formation with heterogeneous players, which converges to a unique stationary equilibrium. Hence,
the structural preference parameters can be estimated using a single network observation.
In addition, the model
provides the first equilibrium micro-foundation of exponential random graphs.
Because of the curse of dimensionality, the likelihood is computationally
intractable. Therefore, I propose a Bayesian estimation strategy that samples from the
posterior, interleaving parameter and network simulations,
without evaluating the likelihood. I prove that
the proposed algorithm converges to the correct posterior distribution.
A mean-field analysis shows that the algorithm converges fast for practical
applications. Estimation is tested with artificial and Add Health data, confirming
evidence of homophily in high schools.

Generosity and social contagion in online networks</a></b>, May 2014<i>, Submitted</i></font><br>

<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong> How do the social media affect the success of charitable promotional campaigns? We use individual-level longitudinal data and experimental data from a social-media application that facilitates donations while broadcasting donors' activities to their contacts. We find that broadcasting is positively associated with donations, although some individuals appear to opportunistically broadcast a pledge, and then delete it. Furthermore, broadcasting a pledge is associated with more pledges by a user's contacts. However, results from a field experiment where broadcasting of the initial pledges was randomized suggest that the observational findings were likely due to homophily rather than genuine social contagion effects. The experiment also shows that, although our campaigns generated considerable attention in the forms of clicks and "likes," only a small number of donations (30 out of 6.4 million users reached) were made. Finally, an online survey experiment showed that both the presence of an intermediary and a fee contributed to the low donation rate. Our findings suggest that online platforms for charitable giving may stimulate costless forms of involvement, but have a smaller impact on actual donations, and that network effects might be limited when it comes to contributing real money to charities.</p>

<i>Revision requested</i>, Journal of the European
Economic Association<br><b>(New version coming soon)</b>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong> This paper explores the effect of racial segregation on public school expenditure in US metropolitan areas and school districts. Our starting point is the literature that relates public good provision to the degree of racial fragmentation in the community. We argue that looking at fragmentation alone may be misleading and that the geographic distribution of different racial groups needs to be taken into account. Greater segregation is associated with more homogeneity in some sub-areas and more heterogeneity in others, and this matters if decisions on spending are taken at aggregation levels lower than the MSA. For given fragmentation, the extent of segregation conveys information on households' possibility to sort into relatively more or less homogeneous jurisdictions. We account for the potential endogeneity of racial segregation and find that the latter has a positive impact on average public school expenditure both at the MSA and at the district level. At the same time, increased segregation leads to more inequality in spending across districts of the same MSA, thus worsening the relative position of poorer districts.

<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong> I analyze the geographic distribution of sex offenders in Urbana and Champaign and test if they live closer to schools than generic residents. If the spatial distribution of sex offenders is the same as that of population as a whole, we should not observe a sex offender systematically closer to schools than a random resident. Using a simple statistical model I test if, conditioning on the distance from schools, the spatial distributions of sex offenders and residents are the same. The results show that this is not the case: on average sex offenders are less likely to locate close to schools than other people. However, I show evidence that there is some heterogeneity among individual schools, some being sex offenders "magnets".

<p align="left"><b>The Determinants of Social Networks in Developing Countries: Some Evidence from Ghana</b></font>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract.</strong> I explore the determinants of social network formation in a developing economy, using data from Ghana. The main contribution is the use of an empirical model of network formation that takes into account the interdependence of the linking decisions among agents. The interdependence implies a simultaneity problem that I solve by estimating the joint distribution of the model instead of a conditional specification. The computational complexity increases and I use MCMC Maximum Likelihood methods for the estimation of relevant parameters. I impose functional forms and restrictions of the parameters that guarantee identification. The results show that the network formation process is driven mainly by gender and wealth. In several specifications religion and clan are also important determinants of the network shape.
